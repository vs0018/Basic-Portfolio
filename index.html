            <p>My name is Valerie Susnick. I have been practicing as a Speech-Language Pathologist for the past 8 years. I have worked primarily with the pediatric population across both the educational and healthcare settings.</p>
            <p>Over the years I accumulated experience working with Assistive Technology. This technology encompasses anything that helps an individual to participate in their daily lives with greater independence.</p>
            <p>Currently I serve as an Augmentative-Alternative Communication Specialist. I specifically help individuals with severe communication impairments find a voice - usually via a speech generating device (SGD).</p>
